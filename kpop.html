          Kpop is South Korean popular music. It is a music genre which includes
          songs ranging from ballads to EDM (of course this includes RnB, jazz,
          hip-hop, and rock). This music style uses sounds and visuals from many
          different eras and styles in combination with modern technology.

          Most performances from K-Pop artists will include an intense
          synchronized dance in which the artists will sing/rap while dancing.
          These performances are individual to each song by the artist and could
          also include a ‘dance break’ in which there is no lyrics and an even
          more complicated or expressive dance sequence.

          K-Pop artists also sell albums but they are not just CDs in a cover.
          K-Pop albums usually include a photo book, photo cards, stickers, and
          of course the CD. Different artists could add more to this list,
          adding calendars or notes from the artist in the albums as well.

          Overall K-pop is a very diverse style of music where each group has a
          concept and a different sound. They provide songs, dances, albums with
          tons of pictures, and fanservice!
